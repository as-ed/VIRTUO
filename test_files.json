After Jesus there were the many women who dominated the house churches and catacombs that defined the faith, of-fering a safe haven for the old Greek sacrament that needed shelter from the wilderness. The witches of Persephone, who were the primary missionaries of the Phocaeans' secret cult, had every incentive to both influence, and in some cases even become, the witches of Christianity. Their sister witches of Dionysus, all across Magna Graecia, were in the same boat. In Jesus--the wizard who died, laid for three days in a cave, and was reborn--they all may have found a brother from the East. And in the Gospel of John they may have immediately recognized the 'True Drink' that guar-anteed the same experience to anybody who consumed the wine god to con-quer death. After all, John appears to be writing for women in Ephesus, just a short hop from Phocaea to its north. If anybody was going to understand his secret 'symbols' and 'language,' it was Greek-speaking women whose very job was to preserve, protect, and defend the magic they had inherited from their Ionian ancestors in Phocaea. And if anybody could identify Je-sus as the new God of Ecstasy, it was the maenads who had kept the cult of Dionysus alive in southern Italy for generations. And for whom Gnosticism would be a seamless transition to the new mystery religion. What? Drugged wine. All those plants, herbs, and fungi so heavily docu-mented by the Father of Drugs in his sophisticated wine formulas, demonstrat-ing a profound knowledge of dosing. With such toxic, deadly species at play, Dioscoridess encyclopedia is proof of a long tradition that could induce the 'not unpleasant visions' in carefully measured amounts of potent botanicals. The archaeochemical finds from Tel Kabri and Tel Kedesh were the real-life examples of spiked potions before Christianity. The paleobotanical discover from the Villa Vesuvio is hard data of a drugged wine in the age of jesus. And whatever pharmakon the Church Father Hippolytus accused Marcus and the female Valentinian Gnostics of consuming. And just maybe, the same phar-makon that fueled the Ancient Greek trips to the underworld in the Christian refrigeria that preceded and later competed with the above-ground Mass. When? The first three hundred years after Jesus's death. Before Christian-ity became legal under Constantine, it was an illegal mystery religion fighting for survival in a hostile and unfriendly world. Its secret meetings and magical"

    "text": "The Gospel of Infinity and the Toad Eucharist With St. Peter's City of the Dead and the Roman catacombs checked off the itinerary, I have only one mission left in the Vatican this week. To learn the ultimate fate of the psychedelic Eucharist. If the Phocaean priestesses and the Gnostic witches helped jump-start Christianity with an iniection of visionary drugs, what happened when the mystical period of paleo-Christianity came to an end? Who inherited the Ancient Greek tradition of spiked wine? From the very beginning, when Saint Paul aired his grievances about the lethal potion in the Letter to the Corinthians, there was always a right Eucharist and a wrong Eucharist. And the Church always sided with the drug-free variety. After the fourth century AD, when the Gnostics largely went missing, Ruck charts a ping-pong battle between the Vatican and its sworn enemies. He notes 'periods of suppression,' followed by revivals of 'renewed heresies, no doubt neo-pagan continuations of Classical rites' that culminated in the 'cults of witchcraff' during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Long disregarded by the classicists and theologians, Ruck has tried to convince his colleagues that drugs are integral to the history of Christianity. And completely failed. Because if they don't want to hear about the sober founders of Western civilization drinking beer laced with"

In his tan jacket, gray scarf, and plaid rain hat--because the Italians love to accessorize, even when its not raining--Gianfranco tells me about the time he got locked in the Secret Archives bunker. Directly beneath us a portion of the Vatican's fifty-three miles of dassified material is stored in a two-story underground vault. The fireproof reinforced-concrete structure is climate and humidity controlled, and sub-ject to constant security surveillance.' There's also an emergency lighting system, though I guess it was on the fritz that fateful day. 'To remain alone, without the lights, and no mobile signal ' says Gi-anfranco, laughing in retrospect, 'is not a good experience, I tell you'. Though he kept his calm and eventually escaped by retracing his steps through the fixed and revolving shelving system, I don't think Gianfranco has quite forgiven the absentminded colleague who accidently left him here in the underworld. Yet another near-death trip into the subterranean cham-bers of the Eternal City. But it's par for the course. When you step foot inside the Secret Archives, you never know what to expect. I had always wanted to take a look for myself, but had no idea where to begin. According to the Vatican's website, no one can access the Pope's files without first identifying the exact 'archival series' of the volumes they in-tend to consult. A semi-impossible task, since the online Collection Index is more of a long, meaningless table of contents, available only in Italian. And it's completely unsearchable by subject matter. There are just broad, general categories of aged documents, arranged by relatively unhelpful headings like the names of centuries-old Popes, the sites of various international del-egations, and lists of random religious orders. If you're looking for drugs, you're fresh out of luck. So if I wanted to fact-check Ruck's notion that a hidden tradition of heretics trafficked in a psychedelic Eucharist for hundreds of years, long after Jesus, I needed a more creative approach. What I was really after was written evidence of the Vatican, in its own penmanship, confronting this supposed network--something that would indicate the past use of drugs in black and white. I had to identify an individual heretic whom I knew the Vatican had hunted down and snuffed out. He or she had to be particularly famous, high-profile enough to have grabbed the Church's attention in the"

In De gli eroici furori (The Heroic Enthusiasts), published in London in 1585, Bruno overplayed his hand in a 'curious episode' that Yates de-scribes as 'the culmination of the whole work.' It's an allegory about nine blind men in search of the same beatific vision that beckoned the pilgrims to Eleusis for two thousand years, the 'highest and final illumination' that reveals the meaning of life. The men leave the idyllic countryside of Bruno's formative years in Campania and make a three-day pilgrimage north along the Mystery Coast Highway to Mount Circeo. It's the very same place where Circe tends her loom on the Vergilius Vaticanus manuscript that helped Dr. Alexia Latini decipher the Homeric fresco in the Hypogeum of the Aurelii once and for all. One of the nine cries out for Circe to brew up a 'remedy' for their afflic-tion with her 'plants' (piante), 'charms' (incanti), and 'drugs' (venefici)? Bruno's word for 'drugs' is straight from the Latin veneficium, which the Lewis and Short dictionary defines as 'the preparation of magic potions.' The men beg for the 'magic herbs' (medicami), but Circe stands firm. Fi-nally, she presents them with an 'elixir' (liquor) containing 'god-like virtue' (la virt√π divina). Sealed in a vase, the magical potion guarantees a vision of two starry objects. After another decade of travel, once their initiation is complete, the men manage to open the vase, reversing their blindness and catching the promised vision of the heavenly suns. In describing the ecstasy that results from witnessing 'the fairest work of God' Bruno gets a little too close to exposing his love of the Greek Mysteries. 'For a time it was like seeing so many frenzied Bacchanals (tanti furiosi debaccanti), inebriated with that which they saw so plainly.' Once again a familiar theme: women and drugs. Bruno was tempting fate by calling up the Vatican's archnemeses. If the Hypogeum of the Aureli is evidence of the 'secret doctrine,' then Perhaps The Heroic Enthusiasts is too. When he invokes Circe and her drugs, is it possible Bruno is talking about a real tradition? One that found its way from ancient Campania to Renaissance Rome, thanks to the Mystery Coast Highway? It's all part of a classical vocabulary that is completely lost on today's readers -the 'body of knowledge' that classicists Hanson and Heath said was 'virtually unrecognized' in the twenty-first century. But the"

In 1942 the former prefect published an inflammatory book, including an Italian translation of the original Bruno manuscript, complete with footnotes and commentary. After some creative googling in the spring of 2018, I was able to tease out the specific citation for Bruno's records, the 'archival series' that the Secret Archives demands before they even consider granting permission for a random American to go sniffing through their dirty laundry. Appropriately Bruno's records were tucked away in some 'miscellaneous' section of the so-called 'Armadi files: Misc., Arm. X, 205. With that I was ready for the formal admissions process. Which was more like an Abbott and Costello routine. I needed a letter of recommenda-tion from a 'qualifed person in the field of historical research,' so I asked Ruck to pen a note on Boston University letterhead, hoping no one at the Vatican would do any creative googling of their own. Ruck kindly obliged. Under the 'research topic' section of the application, I made sure to refer to Giordano Bruno as a 'heretic.' A few weeks later, in May 2018, cut to me and Father Francis in the shadow of Athena's statue in the main reading room of the Vatican Secret Archives. Before our visit to the Louvre and the catacombs over the last few days, it was our very first adventure together. Under the watchful eye of the Greek goddess of Wisdom and the half-dozen all-male library custodians who did not take their eyes off us for a second, the priest and I scanned an ultraviolet light over the yellowed pages of the indictment against the most famous magician ever captured by the Catholic Church. We were lucky to even get hold of the seven-inch-thick volume that hit the desk like a sack of potatoes. At first I was given access only to a digital copy of the trial records saved onto an old-school CD. ROM. In order to see the physical manuscript itself, I had to fill out a one-page special request form that within minutes was personally reviewed by the current prefect in charge of the Secret Archives, His Excellency Sergio Pagano. Yes, his last name means 'pagan' in Italian. In another Abbott and Costello moment, the prefect and I went back and forth through one of the custodians, never actually seeing each other face-to-face. The nervous, confused intermediary had to make three sepa-rate trips to the prefect's office. After my initial request, the prefect wanted to know which specific 'folios,' or pages, Father Francis and I wanted to inspect. I wrote down the folios I had already reviewed in electronic form."

    "text": "plures soles... ac eliam homines). In the passage on the Eucharist, Bruno is quoted by an informant making fun of the Most Blessed Sacrament, calling it a form of 'bestiality, blasphemy, and idolatry' (bestialita, bestemie et idol atria)? Same as today, the sixteenth-century version of the Eucharist could hardly compete with whatever inspired the house churches and catacombs of paleo-Christianity, or the Greek Mysteries long before them. And Bruno knew it. In the wake of the Reformation, during Bruno's lifetime, the Catholics and Protestants were actively fighting over the doctrine of transubstanti-ation that remains the Catholic position to this day. It says the bread and wine of the Eucharist possess some unseen and unfathomable quality that is fundamentally transformed into Jesus's literal body and blood during the Mass, even if they appear unchanged to the untrained eye. According to a Pew poll from July 2019, 69 percent of self-described Catholics don't believe a word of the Church's core teaching. Instead, they see the bread and wine of the Eucharist as mere symbols of the body and blood of Jesus, and nothing more. As the writer Flannery O'Connor pointedly quipped back in 1955, Well, if it's a symbol. To hell with it'. Bruno couldn't have agreed more. As a practical mystic he wanted to get back to basics. Back to the Drug of Immortality that his Greek-speaking ancestors in Campania seemed to know all about. And the kind of psyche-delic lizard potion that turned up at the Villa Vesuvio, only twenty-three kilometers from Bruno's hometown of Nola. His Eucharist was no mere symbol. And no placebo. It was an 'elixir' of 'god-like virtue,' spiked with the 'plants,' 'harms.' and 'drugs' of antiquity's most notorious Greek witch, Circe. Is that how Bruno gained his uncanny knowledge of the inex-haustible, starry universe that he accurately predicted by four centuries, and which modern cosmologists find hard to explain? Natural-born saints and Seers have always reported experiences of cosmic awakening. As have those who spend a lifetime in meditation, like the Tibetan Buddhists that Father Francis studied up in the Himalayas. For the rest of us mere mortals, Bruno dropped some clues that ultimately contributed to his death. Clues about his Eucharist as a fascinating shortcut to enlightenment, the quickest way to heal our blindness to the wonder of the sublime cosmos that surrounds us. Which brings us right back to the one thing that unites every mystical tradition we have reviewed thus far."
